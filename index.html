 <h1>Breaking the Myths around Cybersecurity</h1>
</div>
<div class="des">
 <p>
   1. "Your Business is too small for a cyberattack"
   
   This is one of the most prevalent myths that you need to stop believing right away.  
   Most Small and Mid-Sized Business (SMBs) think that they are safe from all digital threats with the sole reason that
   “their business is too small”. Hackers don’t care about the scale of your operations to target it. 
   Thinking they are small and mid-sized businesses are safe, do not invest in a better security system.
   According to 2019 Data Breach Investigation Report, 58% of data breaches happen among small businesses.
   You need to stay cautious always.
